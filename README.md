XMPP Quake-like Console for Strophe.js

Q: How can I use this?

A: You can just insert the code into developers console and type:

```
StropheConsole.init()
```

or if you need to debug BOSH messages:

```
StropheConsole.init({bosh: true})
```

Try to connect to the serer after these actions and press 'tilde' to see console.
