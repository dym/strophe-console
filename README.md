XMPP Quake-like Console for Strophe.js

Q: How can I use this?

A: You can just insert the code into developers console and type:

```
StropheConsole.init()
```

or if you need to debug BOSH messages:

```
StropheConsole.init({bosh: true})
```

Try to connect to the serer after these actions and press 'tilde' to see console.

The idea to write this console came to me when I was reading very nice book [Professional XMPP Programming with JavaScript and jQuery](http://professionalxmpp.com/) by [Jack Moffitt](http://metajack.im/about/). Also I have reused some code from the book.
